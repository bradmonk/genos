The Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project ([ADSP](https://www.niagads.org/adsp/content/home)) has made available WES data in vcf format. The following is a step-by-step analysis walkthrough of this dataset. Here the ultimate goal is to develop a platform for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis based on genome sequencing information. The data for this analysis can be downloaded here:

* [ADSP_WES_VCF_LATEST_RELEASE.mat](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e3tIbQhcDUF1vofAwf4oYVOl8XriC44v).

Both the dataset and the following analysis code are in MATLAB format. Note however there is an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R.matlab/index.html) for reading .mat files. All MATLAB code and custom functions used in the demo walkthrough below can be downloaded on github: 

* [GENOS GITHUB CODE REPO](https://github.com/subroutines/genos) (aka, here)

A comprehensive genomics analysis and step-by-step code walkthrough (tailored towards machine learning for AD diagnosis) of this dataset can be found on my wiki:

This wiki hosts the most up-to-date information about these resources, and explains the code in this repo in great detail. Here I will just briefly give a few details about the dataset. Oh, and naturally, we are always looking for people to collaborate with so please reach-out if you're interested: bmonk @ ucsd . edu



## ADSP Dataset Compilation

ADSP has combined sequencing data from 25 different consortium studies, and makes for a fun genomics quest. On one hand, combinding data from 25 different sources provides the largest assembled Alzheimer's WES dataset to-date. On the other, this compilation is flush with stratification issues. Here is a summary table of those 25 consortium studies, and their share of participant contributions...
